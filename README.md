# Display your Zenodo Community

_Developed by DARIAH for [www.dariah.eu](https://www.dariah.eu/)_
 
This WordPress plugin allows users to see their [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) Community data.
In order to do so, it needs to have access to the [Zenodo REST API](https://developers.zenodo.org), without it, the
 plugin will not work. When using this plugin, you will also need to accept the Zenodo's 
 [Privacy Policy](https://about.zenodo.org/privacy-policy/) and its [Terms of Use](https://about.zenodo.org/terms/).
