# Display your Zenodo Publications

This WordPress plugin allows users to display content of their [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) Community or the publications of an author using an ORCID on Wordpress pages, for instance, if they wish to integrate a dynamic bibliography of their work with their blog or website.
To do so, access to the [Zenodo REST API](https://developers.zenodo.org/) is required, without it, the
plugin will not work. When using this plugin, you will also need to accept the Zenodoâ€™s [Privacy Policy](https://about.zenodo.org/privacy-policy/) and its [Terms of Use](https://about.zenodo.org/terms/).
Originally, the plugin has been created for and by [DARIAH-EU](https://www.dariah.eu). You can find it implemented here: [https://www.dariah.eu/about/publications/](https://www.dariah.eu/about/publications/).
